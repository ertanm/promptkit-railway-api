## Hotfix Strategy

```
main (production)
  └── hotfix/issue-xxx (branch from main)
       └── Fix → PR → review → merge to main → deploy
```

Rules:
- No feature development during launch week
- All hotfixes go directly to main via PR
- Deploy immediately after merge (auto-deploy via Railway)
- Test fix in staging equivalent before merge if possible
