This is a [Plasmo extension](https://docs.plasmo.com/) project bootstrapped with [`plasmo init`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/plasmo).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
# or
npm run dev
```

Open your browser and load the appropriate development build. For example, if you are developing for the chrome browser, using manifest v3, use: `build/chrome-mv3-dev`.

You can start editing the popup by modifying `popup.tsx`. It should auto-update as you make changes. To add an options page, simply add a `options.tsx` file to the root of the project, with a react component default exported. Likewise to add a content page, add a `content.ts` file to the root of the project, importing some module and do some logic, then reload the extension on your browser.

For further guidance, [visit our Documentation](https://docs.plasmo.com/)

## Making production build (extension)

**Required:** Set `PLASMO_PUBLIC_API_URL` to your production HTTPS API before building:

```bash
export PLASMO_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.promptvault.com  # your API URL
pnpm build:prod
# or
PLASMO_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.promptvault.com npm run build:prod
```

Or add to `.env.production`:
```
PLASMO_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.promptvault.com
```

Then run `pnpm build` (Plasmo loads `.env.production` when `NODE_ENV=production`).

This creates a production bundle ready for the Chrome Web Store. **Do not use `pnpm build` without setting the API URL** — the extension would default to `http://localhost:3000` and fail for users.

Before publishing, run:

```bash
pnpm verify:prod-manifest
```

This verifies: no localhost in manifest or bundle, strict CSP, no dev-only permissions.

## Submit to the webstores

The easiest way to deploy your Plasmo extension is to use the built-in [bpp](https://bpp.browser.market) GitHub action. Prior to using this action however, make sure to build your extension and upload the first version to the store to establish the basic credentials. Then, simply follow [this setup instruction](https://docs.plasmo.com/framework/workflows/submit) and you should be on your way for automated submission!

## Running the API in production

The `promptextension/server` directory contains the API used by the extension. A typical production deployment looks like:

1. Build and publish the Docker image defined in `promptextension/Dockerfile`.
2. Run database migrations with Prisma:

   ```bash
   cd promptextension/server
   pnpm db:generate
   pnpm prisma migrate deploy --schema=../prisma/schema.prisma
   ```

3. Start the container with the required environment variables:

   - `DATABASE_URL` – Postgres connection string (required).
   - `CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` – real Clerk keys (required in production).
   - `CORS_ORIGINS` – comma-separated list of allowed origins. **In production this must not be empty.**
   - `NODE_ENV=production`
   - Optional: `SENTRY_DSN`, `REDIS_URL`, `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.

The server performs startup validation of critical env vars and will refuse to start if:

- Required variables are missing or malformed.
- `NODE_ENV=production` but `CORS_ORIGINS` is empty.

You can health-check the API using:

```bash
curl -f https://your-api/health
```
